## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm Jeremiah!

I'm a second-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Guelph who likes programming.
I mostly mess around in C++, and I've been getting into graphics stuff with OpenGL lately.

I also like reading (big fan of *Lord of the Mysteries*), watching YouTube, and messing with electronics.
